# ofxMeshGen

Originally part of mesh.deform (unreleased). This addon contains several
alternative mesh primitive generators for
[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) with consistent winding order
([related issue](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/2676))
and some utility functions for simple mesh processing.

It's currently very incomplete and only contains primitives that I needed. I might implement some more in the future.
