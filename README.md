# ofxMeshGen

Originally part of [mesh.deform](https://krasjet.com/eidos/mesh.deform/). This
addon contains several alternative mesh primitive generators for
[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) with consistent winding order
([related issue](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/2676))
and some utility functions for simple mesh processing.

It's currently very incomplete and only contains primitives that I needed. I
might implement some more in the future.

There are some extensive documentation in the [header
file](https://github.com/Krasjet/ofxMeshGen/blob/master/src/ofxMeshGen.h).

## Some possible ideas
