ofxMeshGen
----------

Originally part of [mesh.deform][deform]. This addon contains several
alternative mesh primitive generators for [openFrameworks][of] with consistent
winding order ([related issue][issue]) and some utility functions for simple
mesh processing.

It's currently very incomplete and only contains primitives that I needed. I
might implement some more in the future.

There are some extensive documentation in the [header file][header].

Some possible ideas
