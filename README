ofxMeshGen
==========

Originally part of mesh.deform [1]. This addon contains several alternative
mesh primitive generators for openFrameworks [2] with consistent winding order
(related issue see [3]) and some utility functions for simple mesh processing.

It's currently very incomplete and only contains primitives that I needed. I
might implement some more in the future.

There are some extensive documentation in the header file [4].
